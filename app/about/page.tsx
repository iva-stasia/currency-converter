        An interesting fact about currency converters is that their significance
        soared with the internet&apos;s rise. Before digitalization, people
        relied on manual calculations and printed tables for exchange rates. The
        internet transformed this by providing real-time rates and enabling the
        creation of online converters. This shift not only enhanced convenience
        but also democratized access to currency information, making financial
        interactions more transparent and accessible on a global scale.
